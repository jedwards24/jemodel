# TODO

## General

+ I can't find how to import '.' so have removed it from code instead.
  - I have seen it added as `globalVariables(".")` in tidyr in the tidyr.R script.
+ NEWS file and version increment.

## Existing functions

+ glmnet tools (not working correctly). Add tests.

## New functions

These may already be in dev_code().

+ pdp functions (already written but not in package)

## Package check issues

+ bindings for df cols. Need to use .data$ for these
+ Testthat 3.0? https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html
